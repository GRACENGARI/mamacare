# ðŸ¤° MamaCare - Maternal Health Risk Prediction System

## Overview
MamaCare is an AI-powered maternal health risk prediction system that helps healthcare providers assess and classify maternal health risks into three categories: **Low Risk**, **Mid Risk**, and **High Risk**. The system uses machine learning to analyze clinical parameters and provide real-time risk assessments.

## ðŸ”´ Problem Statement
Maternal mortality remains a critical challenge in healthcare systems worldwide. Early identification of high-risk pregnancies can significantly improve outcomes through timely interventions. MamaCare addresses this by providing:

- Automated risk assessment based on clinical parameters
- Real-time predictions for immediate decision support
- Scalable deployment through cloud infrastructure
- Easy integration with existing healthcare systems
